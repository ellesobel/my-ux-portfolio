                <h3>Plant Log Web App</h3>
                <p>
                    A React-based web app that lets users track and manage their plants with ease. 
                    Features include adding and editing plant entries, dynamic filtering and sorting, 
                    and fetching rich plant data from external APIs for images, care instructions, and 
                    species infoâ€”all in a responsive, interactive interface.

                <h3>Image Gallery Web App</h3>
                <p>
                    I created an interactive flower-fact image gallery website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    The site features modal overlays. I also designed this app to flex for all screen sizes &gt;375px.

                <h3>Brand Redesign</h3>
                <p>
                    Revitalized the restaurant&#39;s visual identity, designing a modern logo, color palette, typography, and menu layout. 
                    Applied core design principles like hierarchy, balance, and consistency to create a cohesive, professional, and inviting brand experience.
                    I used HTML and CSS for this redesign.
